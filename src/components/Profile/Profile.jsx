    <p>
      I'm a lifelong technology enthusiast, software fanatic, and overall computer dork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I'm a full stack engineer and strong technical leader with a focus on lean and agile approaches to solving today's product challenges. I have a wide range of experience and an innate ability to quickly identify underlying business requirements to build efficient, scalable, and secure web architectures. I have an extremely vigilant eye for design implementation and adherence to web best-practices, accompanied by a drive to construct team coding standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I'm a tinkerer, foodie, and volunteer. I spend most of my free time woodworking and building furniture, hacking together robots and random electronics, making cheese and experimenting with new cooking techniques, and teaching kids how to code.
